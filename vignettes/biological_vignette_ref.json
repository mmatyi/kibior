		"abstract": "The Human Metabolome Database or HMDB (www.hmdb.ca) is a web-enabled metabolomic database containing comprehensive information about human metabolites along with their biological roles, physiological concentrations, disease associations, chemical reactions, metabolic pathways, and reference spectra. First described in 2007, the HMDB is now considered the standard metabolomic resource for human metabolic studies. Over the past decade the HMDB has continued to grow and evolve in response to emerging needs for metabolomics researchers and continuing changes in web standards. This year's update, HMDB 4.0, represents the most significant upgrade to the database in its history. For instance, the number of fully annotated metabolites has increased by nearly threefold, the number of experimental spectra has grown by almost fourfold and the number of illustrated metabolic pathways has grown by a factor of almost 60. Significant improvements have also been made to the HMDB’s chemical taxonomy, chemical ontology, spectral viewing, and spectral/text searching tools. A great deal of brand new data has also been added to HMDB 4.0. This includes large quantities of predicted MS/MS and GC–MS reference spectral data as well as predicted (physiologically feasible) metabolite structures to facilitate novel metabolite identification. Additional information on metabolite-SNP interactions and the influence of drugs on metabolite levels (pharmacometabolomics) has also been added. Many other important improvements in the content, the interface, and the performance of the HMDB website have been made and these should greatly enhance its ease of use and its potential applications in nutrition, biochemistry, clinical chemistry, clinical genetics, medicine, and metabolomics science.",

		"abstract": "The management of T2DM requires aggressive treatment to achieve glycemic and cardiovascular risk factor goals. In this setting, metformin, an old and widely accepted first line agent, stands out not only for its antihyperglycemic properties but also for its effects beyond glycemic control such as improvements in endothelial dysfunction, hemostasis and oxidative stress, insulin resistance, lipid profiles, and fat redistribution. These properties may have contributed to the decrease of adverse cardiovascular outcomes otherwise not attributable to metformin’s mere antihyperglycemic effects. Several other classes of oral antidiabetic agents have been recently launched, introducing the need to evaluate the role of metformin as initial therapy and in combination with these newer drugs. There is increasing evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies supporting its anti-proliferative role in cancer and possibly a neuroprotective effect. Metformin’s negligible risk of hypoglycemia in monotherapy and few drug interactions of clinical relevance give this drug a high safety profile. The tolerability of metformin may be improved by using an appropiate dose titration, starting with low doses, so that side-effects can be minimized or by switching to an extended release form. We reviewed the role of metformin in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and describe the additional benefits beyond its glycemic effect. We also discuss its potential role for a variety of insulin resistant and pre-diabetic states, obesity, metabolic abnormalities associated with HIV disease, gestational diabetes, cancer, and neuroprotection.",

		"abstract": "Although the mechanisms linking obesity to insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not entirely understood, it is likely that alterations of adipose tissue function are involved. The aim of this study was to identify new genes controlling insulin sensitivity in adipocytes from obese women with either insulin resistant (OIR) or sensitive (OIS) adipocytes. Insulin sensitivity was first determined by measuring lipogenesis in isolated adipocytes from abdominal subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) in a large observational study. Lipogenesis was measured under conditions where glucose transport was the rate limiting step and reflects in vivo insulin sensitivity. We then performed microarray-based transcriptome profiling on subcutaneous WAT specimen from a subgroup of 9 lean, 21 OIS and 18 obese OIR women. We could identify 432 genes that were differentially expressed between the OIR and OIS group (FDR ≤5%). These genes are enriched in pathways related to glucose and amino acid metabolism, cellular respiration, and insulin signaling, and include genes such as SLC2A4, AKT2, as well as genes coding for enzymes in the mitochondria respiratory chain. Two IR-associated genes, KLF15 encoding a transcription factor and SLC25A10 encoding a dicarboxylate carrier, were selected for functional evaluation in adipocytes differentiated in vitro. Knockdown of KLF15 and SLC25A10 using siRNA inhibited insulin-stimulated lipogenesis in adipocytes. Transcriptome profiling of siRNA-treated cells suggested that KLF15 might control insulin sensitivity by influencing expression of PPARG, PXMP2, AQP7, LPL and genes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Knockdown of SLC25A10 had only modest impact on the transcriptome, suggesting that it might directly influence insulin sensitivity in adipocytes independently of transcription due to its important role in fatty acid synthesis. In summary, this study identifies novel genes associated with insulin sensitivity in adipocytes in women independently of obesity. KFL15 and SLC25A10 are inhibitors of insulin-stimulated lipogenesis under conditions when glucose transport is the rate limiting step.",

The aims were to (1) evaluate the activity of UPR in NAFL and NASH and (2) correlate expression of UPR pathways with liver histology. Methods: Messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. Apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL assay. Liver histology was scored using the NASH clinical research network criteria. Results: Compared with subjects with the metabolic syndrome and normal liver histology (n = 17), both NAFL (n = 21) and NASH (n = 21) were associated with increased eukaryotic initiation factor-2α (eIF-2α) phosphorylation. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) mRNA and protein, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and growth arrest, DNA damage-34 (GADD34) mRNA were not increased in NAFL or NASH. Whereas immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein mRNA was significantly increased in NASH, unspliced X-box protein-1 (XBP-1) protein did not increase. Also, endoplasmic reticulum degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein mRNA levels were inversely related to spliced XBP-1 mRNA in NASH. NASH was specifically associated with low sXBP-1 protein and increased JNK phosphorylation. This correlated with increased TUNEL activity in NASH. The histologic severity correlated with sXBP-1 mRNA and JNK phosphorylation. Conclusions: There is a variable degree of UPR activation in NAFL and NASH. Although both NAFL and NASH are associated with eIF-2α phosphorylation, there is a failure to activate downstream recovery pathways, ie, ATF4-CHOP-GADD34. NASH is specifically associated with (1) failure to generate sXBP-1 protein and (2) activation of JNK.",

VEGF can inhibit the function of T cells, increase the recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and hinder the differentiation and activation of dendritic cells (DCs). Recent studies have investigated the role of antiangiogenic agents in antitumor immunity, especially in recent three years. Therefore, it is necessary to update the role of targeting VEGF/VEGFR in anti-tumor immunity. In this review, we focus on the latest clinical and preclinical findings on the modulatory role of antiangiogenic agents targeting VEGF/VEGFR in immune cells, including effector T cells, Tregs, MDSCs, DCs, tumor-associated macrophages and mast cells. Our review will be potentially helpful for the development of combinations of angiogenesis inhibitors with immunological modulators.",

Depending on the level of complementarity between the miRNA and mRNA target, they can either inhibit translation or degrade the target mRNA. MiRNAs expression is specific to the type of cancer, its stage and level of metastasis, making miRNAs potential stage-specific biomarkers of cancer. Recent research has shown that these miRNAs have the potential to be a diagnostic and prognostic non-invasive biomarker for various cancers including prostate cancer. Various miRNAs have been reported as novel biomarkers for prostate cancer therapy. However, there is inconsistency in the data reported and no overlapping expression pattern could be found. In this review, we have highlighted the most consistently reported dysregulated miRNAs in prostate cancer from the existing literature and discussed the currently available data on their role in regulating the hallmarks of prostate cancer.These four most consistently reported dysregulated miRNAs viz. miRNA-141, miRNA-375, miRNA-221 and miRNA-21 need to be further validated in terms of their regulatory potential in regulating various pathways important for prostate cancer management.",

		"abstract": "Protein expression across human tissues\nSequencing the human genome gave new insights into human biology and disease. However, the ultimate goal is to understand the dynamic expression of each of the approximately 20,000 protein-coding genes and the function of each protein. Uhlén et al. now present a map of protein expression across 32 human tissues. They not only measured expression at an RNA level, but also used antibody profiling to precisely localize the corresponding proteins. An interactive website allows exploration of expression patterns across the human body.\nScience, this issue 10.1126/science.1260419\nStructured Abstract\nINTRODUCTIONResolving the molecular details of proteome variation in the different tissues and organs of the human body would greatly increase our knowledge of human biology and disease. Here, we present a map of the human tissue proteome based on quantitative transcriptomics on a tissue and organ level combined with protein profiling using microarray-based immunohistochemistry to achieve spatial localization of proteins down to the single-cell level. We provide a global analysis of the secreted and membrane proteins, as well as an analysis of the expression profiles for all proteins targeted by pharmaceutical drugs and proteins implicated in cancer.\nRATIONALEWe have used an integrative omics approach to study the spatial human proteome. Samples representing all major tissues and organs (n = 44) in the human body have been analyzed based on 24,028 antibodies corresponding to 16,975 protein-encoding genes, complemented with RNA-sequencing data for 32 of the tissues. The antibodies have been used to produce more than 13 million tissue-based immunohistochemistry images, each annotated by pathologists for all sampled tissues. To facilitate integration with other biological resources, all data are available for download and cross-referencing.\nRESULTSWe report a genome-wide analysis of the tissue specificity of RNA and protein expression covering more than 90% of the putative protein-coding genes, complemented with analyses of various subproteomes, such as predicted secreted proteins (n = 3171) and membrane-bound proteins (n = 5570). The analysis shows that almost half of the genes are expressed in all analyzed tissues, which suggests that the gene products are needed in all cells to maintain “housekeeping” functions such as cell growth, energy generation, and basic metabolism. Furthermore, there is enrichment in metabolism among these genes, as 60% of all metabolic enzymes are expressed in all analyzed tissues. The largest number of tissue-enriched genes is found in the testis, followed by the brain and the liver. Analysis of the 618 proteins targeted by clinically approved drugs unexpectedly showed that 30% are expressed in all analyzed tissues. An analysis of metabolic activity based on genome-scale metabolic models (GEMS) revealed liver as the most metabolically active tissue, followed by adipose tissue and skeletal muscle.\nCONCLUSIONSA freely available interactive resource is presented as part of the Human Protein Atlas portal (www.proteinatlas.org), offering the possibility to explore the tissue-elevated proteomes in tissues and organs and to analyze tissue profiles for specific protein classes. Comprehensive lists of proteins expressed at elevated levels in the different tissues have been compiled to provide a spatial context with localization of the proteins in the subcompartments of each tissue and organ down to the single-cell level. <img class=\"fragment-image\" aria-describedby=\"F1-caption\" src=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/347/6220/1260419/F1.medium.gif\"/> Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint The human tissue–enriched proteins.All tissue-enriched proteins are shown for 13 representative tissues or groups of tissues, stratified according to their predicted subcellular localization. Enriched proteins are mainly intracellular in testis, mainly membrane bound in brain and kidney, and mainly secreted in pancreas and liver.\nResolving the molecular details of proteome variation in the different tissues and organs of the human body will greatly increase our knowledge of human biology and disease. Here, we present a map of the human tissue proteome based on an integrated omics approach that involves quantitative transcriptomics at the tissue and organ level, combined with tissue microarray–based immunohistochemistry, to achieve spatial localization of proteins down to the single-cell level. Our tissue-based analysis detected more than 90% of the putative protein-coding genes. We used this approach to explore the human secretome, the membrane proteome, the druggable proteome, the cancer proteome, and the metabolic functions in 32 different tissues and organs. All the data are integrated in an interactive Web-based database that allows exploration of individual proteins, as well as navigation of global expression patterns, in all major tissues and organs in the human body.\nTranscriptomics and immunohistochemistry map protein expression across 32 human tissues.\nTranscriptomics and immunohistochemistry map protein expression across 32 human tissues.",

		"abstract": "MicroRNAs are natural, single-stranded, small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by binding to target mRNAs and suppress its translation or initiate its degradation. In contrast to the identification and validation of many miRNA genes is the lack of experimental evidence identifying their corresponding mRNA targets. The most fundamental challenge in miRNA biology is to define the rules of miRNA target recognition. This is critical since the biological role of individual miRNAs will be dictated by the mRNAs that they regulate. Therefore, only as target mRNAs are validated will it be possible to establish commonalities that will enable more precise predictions of miRNA/mRNA interactions. Currently there is no clear agreement as to what experimental procedures should be followed to demonstrate that a given mRNA is a target of a specific miRNA. Therefore, this review outlines several methods by which to validate miRNA targets. Additionally, we propose that multiple criteria should be met before miRNA target validation should be considered “confirmed.”",

In the event of recurrence and/or metastasis, androgen ablation therapy has been the mainstay treatment for many years. Although initially effective, the cancer inevitably recurs as androgen-independent PCa, a disease with limited effective treatments. Enhanced predictive biomarkers are needed at the time of diagnosis to better tailor therapies for patients. MicroRNAs are short nucleotide sequences which can complementary bind to and control gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Recent studies have demonstrated that many miRNAs are variably expressed in cancers vs. normal tissues, including PCa. In this review, we summarize PCa-specific miRNAs that show potential for their utilization as identifiers of aggressive disease and predictors for risk of recurrence. Additionally, we discuss their potential clinical applications as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",

Indeed, microbiome-driven drug metabolism is essential for the activation of certain prodrugs, for example, azo drugs such as prontosil and neoprontosil resulting in the release of sulfanilamide. In addition to providing a major source of reductive metabolizing capability, the gut microbiota provides a suite of additional reactions including acetylation, deacylation, decarboxylation, dehydroxylation, demethylation, dehalogenation, and importantly, in the context of certain types of drug-related toxicity, conjugates hydrolysis reactions. In addition to direct effects, the gut microbiota can affect drug metabolism and toxicity indirectly via, for example, the modulation of host drug metabolism and disposition and competition of bacterial-derived metabolites for xenobiotic metabolism pathways. Also, of course, the therapeutic drugs themselves can have effects, both intended and unwanted, which can impact the health and composition of the gut microbiota with unforeseen consequences.",
