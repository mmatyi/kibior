#' Instances of Kibior are object that allow to use Elasticsearch power and execute lots of predefined 
#' requests such as searching in massive amounts of data, joins between in-memory data and Elasticsearch 
#' indices, push and pull data to and from multiples Elasticsearch servers, and more. This little 
#' utilitary was built in the context of massive data invading biology and bioinformatics, but is completely
#' versatile and can be applied to other fields. By adding it to R-scripts, it can perform several 
#' useful tasks such as: saving intermediary results, sharing them with a collaborator, automating 
#' import and upload of lots of files directly, and much more.
